This is a program that runs on OpenCV.
It takes a snapshot using your webcam.
Then it analyses the photograph and adjusts your screen brightness accordingly.

Make sure `OpenCV` and `xrandr` are installed

`The code does have a few bugs.
xrandr is unable to set the brightness accordingly
as it can only adjust the brightness with respect to the
brightness that was manually set by the user.
This will be fixed as immediately as possible`
