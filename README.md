This is a program that runs on OpenCV.
It takes a snapshot using your webcam.
Then it analyses the photograph and adjusts your screen brightness accordingly.

Make sure `OpenCV' is installed.

Maku sure you're root user when running this code
`sudo` command shouldn't be enough
you'll have to use `su` itself.
